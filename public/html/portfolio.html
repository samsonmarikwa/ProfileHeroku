                    <p>The game opens up in a new tab. In the game, the computer picks a random state out of the 13 states that originally declared independence from England and the British Crown. The user is given a hint by the dashes that show the length
                        of the state name. The user is given chances equal to the length of the state picked to type the correct state. When a user gets all the 13 states correct, the computer will notify the user that he has won the game and will play
                        The Spangled Banner. If a user has not won the game, an uplifting background sound is then played and the user can then refresh the page and start the game again.

                    <p>The Cystals Collector game opens up in a new tab. In the game, the computer picks a random number between 19 and 120 which is used as the target the player should match.

                        <br>The user is then given four crystals which also have random number attributes between 1 and 12. The user only knows the random number assigned to the crystal when he/she clicks on the crystal. The crystal random number is accumulated
                        to a score each time the user clicks it. If the score matches the target number, then the player wins the game. If the score exceeds the target then the player has lost the game. The game restarts after 5 seconds and the player
                        can start playing the game again.

                        are able to access data and system functions programmatically. This is achieved through APIs in those organization's systems that are exposed through a URL on the internet. Search parameters are provided through the URL as per

                        able to dynamically add a button on the page by searching for a politician, fan or any subject that may have gifs on the Giphy site. The user is able to save the giphy images to a favorite section. To save the images, I am using

                    <p>Bamazon is a command-line application that uses node.js and MySQL. Three programs make up the Bamazon application, which are bamazonCustomer.js, bamazonManager.js and bamazonSupervisor.js. Four packages were installed from npmjs namely
                        dotenv to load environmental variables to the process.env object in node, MySQL which is a MySQL driver for node.js, easy-table which is a utility for rendering text tables with javascript and lastly the Inquirer package to provide
                        a user interface and session flow for the user to interact with the application. To use this application, a user will be required to create a database in MySQL using the script in the folder sql. The script name is createBamazon.sql.
                        The user is then required to create a .env file with a password to access MySQL database.
                        <br><br>The bamazonCustomer allows a customer to place orders in the system. Some data validation takes place in the program using Inquirer. The bamazonManager allows a manager to access the application to check on inventory that
                        is available for sale, inventory below minimum level and allows the manager to add new products and replenish stocks. The bamazonSupervisor allows a supervisor to get a report on sales and to create new departments. All records
                        created are saved in the bamazon MySQL database.

                        section. If the user clicks the Devout It button which is next to the burger, the burger is moved to the Devoured section..</p>
                    <p>The application uses Express web server, Handlebars templating engine with partials displaying the Available and Devoured sections. A MySQL database is used for persistence. Ajax is used to communicate from the front-end to the backend
                        APIs. The application coding is structured following the MVC model. I have developed an ORM framework to interact with the database. The objective of developing the ORM is to have an understanding of the underlying design of the
                        existing ORM Frameworks on the market such as Sequelize.. Click <a href="https://glacial-fjord-45128.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Eat-Da-Burger</a> to use the application deployed on Heroku.

                    <p>Air Quality App is a CRUD web-based application that allows users to register to the database. Once registered, users will get e-mails with current quality of the air and a link that will allow them to login to the website to see more
                        information such as the forecast.<br>An Express server with Sequelize to handle MySQL database transactions, bodyparser, request and path are the main modules making up the backend setup of the application. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/airnow"
                            target="_blank">airnow npm module</a> is used to retrieve information that is then mailed to users via the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer" target="_blank">Nodemailer npm module</a>. These two modules represent
                        the backbone of the application setup. The Sequelize model is defined with validation parameters and a catch statement is coded for the AJAX APIs on the server that insert or amend user data in the database. Please click <a href="https://frozen-caverns-11801.herokuapp.com/"
